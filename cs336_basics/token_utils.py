def gpt2_bytes_to_unicode() -> Mapping[int, str]:
    """Returns a mapping between every possible byte (an integer from 0 to 255)
    to a printable unicode string character representation. This function is
    taken from the GPT-2 code.

    For example, `chr(0)` is `\x00`, which is an unprintable character:

    >>> chr(0)
    '\x00'
    >>> print(chr(0))

    As a result, this function returns a dictionary `d` where `d[0]` returns
    `Ā`. The bytes that are visually printable keep their original string
    representation [1]. For example, `chr(33)` returns `!`, and so accordingly
    `d[33]` returns `!`. Note in particular that the space character `chr(32)`
    becomes `d[32]`, which returns 'Ġ'.

    For unprintable characters, the function shifts takes the integer
    representing the Unicode code point of that character (returned by the
    Python `ord`) function and shifts it by 256. For example, `ord(" ")`
    returns `32`, so the the space character ' ' is shifted to `256 + 32`.
    Since `chr(256 + 32)` returns `Ġ`, we use that as the string representation
    of the space.

    This function can simplify the BPE implementation and makes it slightly
    easier to manually inspect the generated merges after they're serialized to
    a file.
